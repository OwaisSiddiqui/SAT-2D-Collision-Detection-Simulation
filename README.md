# Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) 2D collision detection simulation (with object reponse)
This is a 2D Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) circle with rectangle collision detection simulation with object response using minimum translation vector method.

# Installation
First git clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/OwaisSiddiqui/SAT-2D-Collision-Detection-Simulation`
Then, execute the following commands to run the simulation:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py 
```

# Usage
Use your mouse to move the circle around the space and push the rectangle. Each time the circle detects being in contact with the rectangle, it turns red. The rectangle, in response, will move accordingly.
