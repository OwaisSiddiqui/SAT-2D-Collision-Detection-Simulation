# Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) 2D collision detection simulation (with object reponse)
This is a 2D Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) circle with rectangle collision detection simulation with object response.

# Installation
To run this simulation, download the `SATCircleRectangleCollisionDetection.py` file from the repository and run it (click on the file or double click it). 

# Usage
Use your mouse to move the circle around the space and push the rectangle. Each time the circle detects being in contact with the rectangle, it turns red. The rectangle, in response, will move accordingly.
